This Python script implements a simple user authentication system using salted password hashing. It utilizes the hashlib library for secure password hashing and os library for generating random salts. No additional libraries need to be installed as both hashlib and os are built-in Python libraries. Users can create accounts with unique usernames and passwords, which are securely stored in memory. During login, passwords are hashed with the corresponding salt and compared for authentication. The system provides basic functionality for user creation, login, and exiting the program.
